All major projects in the course "Computer Vision" - which was on the 2nd year in my CS degree.

# Augmented reality
<h3>
  In this project, we want to switch an item in a given video
  first let's see the inputted video:
  <br>
  <br><img src="res/inputVid.gif" width="300" height="500"/><br>
  We want to switch the image in the video with this photo:
  <br>
  <br><img src="Augmented reality/newImage.jpg" width="200" height="200"/><br>
  
  The is the result:
  <br>
  <br><img src="res/outputVid.gif" width="300" height="500"/><br>
 you can try it yourself! switch the file in path "Augmented reality/newImage.jpg" with a new image and run "Augmented reality/perspective_warping.py".
 
 <h3>Lane Detection<h3/>
  in this project we'll detect lanes and lane changes in a given video.
  for example with this video:
  <br>
  <br><img src="res/roadtripOutput.gif" width="300" height="500"/><br>
  
  after running the program we'll have this video:
  <br>
  <br><img src="res/roadtrip.gif" width="300" height="500"/><br>
 you can try it yourself! switch the file in path "Lane detection/roadtrip.mp4" with a new video and run "Lane detection/projectLanes.py".
